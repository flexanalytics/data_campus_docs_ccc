Full-time equivalent students (FTES) is a standard statewide workload measure equivalent to 525 hours of student instruction (15 Class hours per week x traditional 35-week academic year = 525). FTES represents neither student headcount nor student enrollment, but it is a conceptual measure of student enrollment. The formula to calculate FTES is expressed by the equation below:

FTES = (Census enrollment X Weekly student contact hours X Term Length Multiplier) / 525

Note: excludes Audit and repeat codes 06, 34, 37 student enrollments

Example: FTES for a full-term 3 unit class with 40 students enrolled at census
(40 students x 3 hours/week x 17.5 weeks/semester) / 525 = 4 FTES
